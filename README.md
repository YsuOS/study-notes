# What is a purpose of this notes?
- keep my study motivation
  - If I write tips in my private repository, I should stop this challenge tomorrow.. 
- improve my English skill
  - It is also very important for me. As I said, if I make this repository in my private repository,
    I should write tips in Japanese.
I mean, you know.., this repository is __for myself!!__

# What do I write tips?
We can refer these links below.

NOTE: Because of my company policy, I can't write some tips which relate to my research topics or my team's topics.

Actually, I really want to write tips about them. The rule may disturb this attempt.
